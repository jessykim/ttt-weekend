## Background & Description
Welcome to Tic-Tac-**TURBO**!<br />
This was the first browser game I built during my time in the Software Engineering Immersive Program at General Assembly. 

The theme for Tic-Tac-Turbo was inspired by my pet rabbit, Turbo, who makes an appearance when Player 1 wins. I wanted to add a personal touch to the game, which made it even more enjoyable to build!
